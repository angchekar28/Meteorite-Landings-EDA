# 🌠 Meteorite Landings - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Meteorite Landings dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The dataset contains information about meteorites that have landed on Earth, including their name, mass, classification, location, and year of discovery. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to meteorite impacts.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)  
- **Key Features**:
  - `name`: Name of the meteorite
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `mass (g)`: Mass of the meteorite in grams
  - `recclass`: Classification type
  - `fall`: Whether the meteorite was "Fell" or "Found"
  - `year`: Year of discovery
  - `reclat`, `reclong`: Latitude and longitude of impact location

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values  
- Conduct **descriptive analysis** to summarize key statistics  
- Visualize **distribution of meteorite mass, locations, and classifications**  
- Identify **trends over time** in meteorite discoveries  
- Explore the relationship between **meteorite size and impact location**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook**  

## 📊 Key Insights  
🔹 The majority of recorded meteorites are relatively **small in mass**.  
🔹 Meteorite discoveries have **increased over time**, likely due to better tracking.  
🔹 The most common meteorite classification is **"L6"**, a type of chondrite.  
🔹 The USA and Antarctica have **a high number of recorded landings**, due to active research efforts.
